# WARNING:

This project is not developed anymore. It just creates too much work rather than saving time in the new quest implementing process. For a little bit longer explanation see: [PR #1005 of StreetComplete](https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/pull/1005#discussion_r181548725)

# StreetComplete QuestCreator

The StreetComplete QuestCreator is a tool for creating new quests for the android application [StreetComplete](https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/)

### Getting started

Create your first quest by opening the [StreetComplete QuestCreator](https://ent8r.github.io/StreetCompleteQuestCreator/) and simply fill in the form which you can see there.

At the end you have to press the button which says "Create quest" and then you can either download all generated files as a zip archive and create a new pull request on your own or download the files and send them to [ENT8R](mailto:info.ent8r@gmail.com) who will implement the quest for you.
